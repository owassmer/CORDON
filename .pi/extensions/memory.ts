/**
 * The coordinator's memory: what stays in its context, what is derived, what is carried across a compaction, and how
 * the past is reached again.
 *
 * Why: Pi's own compaction summarizes what happened, the state and what is next. For a coordinator that loses two
 * things. The state it wrote goes stale (runs finished unreported, a retired task relaunched), and the reasons behind
 * Owen's corrections shrink to a list of constraints, followed after their basis has gone. CORDON's coordinators have
 * lost their alignment at compaction again and again, so memory is rebuilt from what each part of it is, not as one
 * summary:
 *
 * - Prune: tool output is re-derivable from its source, and is most of a context's bulk. Once it is a few exchanges
 *   old it is replaced in context by a one-line stub (a context_edit; the raw entry stays in the session file). The
 *   correspondence with Owen stays whole far longer, and less is ever lost to a compaction.
 * - Derive: what the session itself records is read from its entries, exactly, by code: each question put to Owen
 *   with his answer (the ask tool makes these structured where they are given), each dispatch, steer and stop, each
 *   pull request opened, each reload. Where the work stands (checkouts, CI, runs, slots, pull requests) is read from
 *   its records when needed: right after a compaction, and on /standing. None of it is written by a model, so none of
 *   it is paraphrased wrong or goes stale.
 * - Revise: the shared understanding (the reasons Owen and the coordinator arrived at, and what each owes the other)
 *   is held as items with ids. At a compaction, the compaction model sees the whole span since the last one, so it sees
 *   each correction in proportion, and returns edits to the items, never a new text; code applies them, so an item
 *   nobody touched is carried through word for word.
 * - Recall: the recall tool returns past exchanges verbatim by the entry ids the understanding cites, so a reason can
 *   be re-read in its original context rather than trusted as a paraphrase.
 * - Frame: the coordinator works each piece from a frame it writes from the purpose before opening the nearest thing
 *   at hand: what must be true at the consumer surface when it is done, the whole of what bears and what each part is
 *   for, and the unit and what it unifies or removes. A rule held far back in the context loses, at the moment of
 *   choosing, to the file just opened. So the frame is kept in view: once the output since it last appeared passes a
 *   size, it is added again after the current calls, as a message in the transcript (never edited in before a request,
 *   which would discard the provider's cache).

export const REVISION = `You revise the understanding a coordinator carries across a compaction of its conversation with Owen. The coordinator builds CORDON with Owen, delegating separable work to builders and reviewers, and is judged by how rarely Owen has to restore the purpose to it. After this compaction it continues with this understanding, the most recent turns, its standing instructions, the records it can read, a ledger of what the session recorded exactly (questions asked with Owen's answers, dispatches, pull requests, reloads) and a recall tool that returns any past exchange verbatim by its entry id. So do not record what happened, and do not record state (runs, branches, files, pull requests): those are read exactly from their records. Record only the understanding.

The understanding is the reasons Owen and the coordinator arrived at (about the product, about how work is delegated and judged, about how they work together) and what each currently owes the other. It is held as items. You see the current items and the whole conversation since the last compaction, so you can see each part of it in proportion to the whole; return edits to the items as JSON, never a new text.

The understanding is one whole, kept in proportion: as few items as the reasons need, each general enough that the next case is an instance of it. It is revised toward that each time, so it does not grow with the conversation. Read the span first for what it shows of reasons the items already hold: a correction is usually a case of one, so revise that item to state the reason so it covers the case, in no more words than before where you can. Add an item only for a reason no item holds or could hold. Where items share a reason, merge them into one that states it. Retire what no longer bears on the work ahead, and commitments met. State each item in a few sentences: the reason, what it serves, and its scope. Its cases (a unit, a figure, a pull request, what one run did) are evidence, kept by its sources and recall, so an item names one only where the reason cannot be understood without it. Sources are the entries that established or changed the reason, not every entry that touched it. What is open is what one owes the other, not the steps of a plan (a pull request's plan holds those).

- Name every item in exactly one edit (revise, merge or retire), so each is decided and none stays by being passed over. An item that stays is restated (revise), in a few sentences, as the reason it is now, with what the conversation added; one that is a case of another, or one reason with others, is merged into the item that states it.
- revise an item the conversation refined or corrected, or that can be said more generally and shorter; name the entry ids that changed it.
- merge items that are one reason, or cases of one.
- retire an item whose basis has gone, a commitment that was met, or one another item now holds, saying why.
- add an item only for a reason or commitment no item holds.

Each item is a reason, not a rule: why it holds and what it serves, with the scope it was given. A rule without its reason gets followed after its basis is gone, which is the failure this exists to prevent. Read each of Owen's corrections for what it did: corrected one action, supplied a fact, set a lasting constraint, or moved the destination; a correction of one action that has since been applied is not an item. Mark where each item stands: "owen" (his own position), "confirmed" (the coordinator's framing Owen confirmed, often the clearer statement of what he meant), "reading" (the coordinator's, not yet confirmed), or "commitment" (something one owes the other, still open). Where an item stands and its ids say where it came from, not why it holds: state the reason in terms of the purpose, the domain's real practice and the history, so it holds for whoever reads it. Use Owen's words where his wording carries the meaning. Cite the entry ids (shown as [id]) each item rests on. Group items by what they govern with short group names; reuse the existing names. Leave out the history of mistakes and what an owner already holds in full (the purpose, principles and procedure in AGENTS.md and the constitution; current state and next steps in state/CURRENT.json; a unit's plan and result in its pull request); point to those where they bear on an item.
