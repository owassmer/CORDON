# Stage D input map

This is the front door to Stage D. It starts with facts required by accepted A–C,
then identifies the source that can supply them. After the 10 September purge,
the bounded national calendar remained retained. The monitoring-observation
family is established (first row, details below); prior acquisitions and case
demonstrations confer no completion on the other rows.

| A–C needs to know | Real source | What one record means | What D must establish |
|---|---|---|---|
| What was observed, where and when, including positive, negative and other results | Regional campaign workbooks, CKAN CSV and SIT monitoring point layers | One published observation, sample, visual inspection or assessment | Established. `cordon_d.monitoring.observations` streams every retained release; `distinct_observations` relates the publications of one observation; `detection_days`, `occasion_sets` and `located_positives` hand C its candidates. Meaning and limits below. |
| What the laboratory actually reported | The official report linked from the monitoring record | One laboratory report containing one or more sample results | Follow every referenced report; join its rows to observations; preserve report corrections and distinct copies |
| Which legally adopted area contained the location on the event date | SIT demarcated-area geometry and the adopting regional act | One published area feature in one legal version | Acquire every version reached by A; bind geometry to its adopting act; use the version in force at the event time |
| Which plants or surfaces fall inside C's distance and survey calculations | Monitoring observations, PuntiStampa, land-use or host-bearing surfaces, parcels and other population records required by the calculation | An observation, published point or polygon, parcel, grid cell or host-bearing surface according to its own source | Establish the actual population represented by each source and never substitute positives for all plants |
| Which cadastral parcel contains or intersects a relevant location | Agenzia delle Entrate and SIT cadastral geometry | One parcel geometry with its cadastral reference | Acquire the reached parcel population and preserve the source identifier; do not infer ownership from geometry |
| Whether the Osservatorio issued a removal measure and which plants or parcels it covered | Regional removal determination and its incorporated annexes | One adopted act plus its source-defined subject rows | Read identity, operative clause, branch, annex incorporation and correction relationships through one general reader |
| Whether a legally consequential notice, delivery, publication, receipt or response happened | The Osservatorio's protocol and PEC records; a municipal register only where the governing measure uses it | One event concerning one document, sender, recipient and time | Use the operator's own record when it holds the event; distinguish sending, delivery, publication and response |
| Who has the consequential relationship to the affected land | Owner/cadastral data in the Osservatorio matter or a competent public-asset record | One stated ownership, occupation, management or other legally relevant relationship | Establish current standing for the affected subject; public-land catalogues and parcel maps are only candidates until they do |
| Whether an affected plant has protected status | The regional monumental-tree register and the matter's exact plant evidence | One registered or provisional protected-plant occurrence | Match the affected plant and select the status in force at the event time |
| Whether protected status requires another permission for this removal | The exact PPTR/local rule and competent authority decision reached by that plant and intervention | One applicable protection rule or one issued decision | Investigate this only for an affected protected plant; the full Puglia landscape-proceeding catalogue is not the population |
| Who was assigned, what field work occurred, whether removal was completed and what lawful cost resulted | Osservatorio and executing-body casefile and field records | One assignment, assessment, treatment, removal, inspection, completion or cost event | Read the actual first-party records for the matter; public procedure manuals cannot fill absent events |
| Any vector or treatment observation required by an accepted calculation | Official Osservatorio, ARIF or incorporated scientific monitoring | One observation for a stated place, period, method and subject | Name the exact C consumer first, then acquire the corresponding observation population |
| Which days count for a working-day clock | Italian holiday law and enacted one-off changes | One national calendar rule | Maintain only the years reached by accepted B clocks |

## Monitoring observations

The source population is `corpus/sources/monitoring/`: the twelve campaign
workbooks and the CKAN CSV under `campaign/`, and all 101 observation point
layers of the eight SIT services that publish them under `sit/<service>/<layer>/`.
Acquisition records name each release and page; `scripts/acquire_monitoring.py`
recaptures them without reusing old bytes. Of the 194 SIT services these eight
are the only ones with observation points. `MonitoraggioXFPasp` holds
nursery-site and Leccino-planting polygons and is not an observation source;
grid, cadastre and buffer polygons belong to the area, population and parcel rows.

`observations(root)` reads every record of every retained release through one
path and keeps every original field: 4,318,100 observations. `distinct_observations(root)`
relates them: one publisher reference on one day is one observation, wherever it
is published. That gives 2,320,354 distinct observations — 1,867,537 identified by
a reference, with at most five publications each (workbook, CSV, host view,
positives view, infected-plant layer), and 452,817 that cannot be related to
anything. Counts across releases and views are never additive: 688,519
observations appear in workbook, CSV and SIT; 590,971 in workbook and SIT;
587,422 only in SIT (visual inspections, assessments, the current campaign and
the infected-plant layers); 549 only in a workbook.

| Published fields | Usable input and meaning |
|---|---|
| `ID`, `ID_CAMPIONE`; earlier `NUMERO_ORDINE`, `OBJECTID`, daily and device identifiers | From 2018 the reference identifies one observation across its publications. In the 2013–2017 SIT views it is a daily counter: one value covers up to eleven plants of different species on one day. A value a view gives to several rows on one day is not an identifier; those rows stay single, uncorrelated observations. Administrative and view identifiers never identify a physical plant. |
| `DATA_RILEVAMENTO`, `DATA_CAMPIONE`, `DATA_PRELIVEO`, `DATA_RILIEVO` | The recorded observation or sampling day. Excel midnight is date storage; ArcGIS UTC epoch values are converted to the Puglia calendar day, and the early campaign's 23:00 UTC values belong to the following local day. Campaign names are not date boundaries. Report, protocol and removal dates remain separate fields. |
| `TIPOLOGIA`; explicitly named visual-inspection and assessment views | Distinguish samples, visual inspections and assessments. An observation without an analytical result is not a negative test; the 2018–2020 inspection and assessment views have no result field at all. |
| `RISULTATO` | The publisher's label: Positivo, Negativo, Dubbio, In attesa, Positivo duplicato, Da ricampionare, Ispezione visiva, Sintomatico, Positivo estirpato (the 2013–2017 removed-plant layers). A blank is unpublished. A duplicate label restates the positive it accompanies and is not a positive by itself. The label is the observation-result part of `official-finding` and `survey-performance`; the finding is the report's (next row). |
| `SPECIE`, `CULTIVAR`, `SUBSPECIE` | Recorded host, cultivar and explicit sample-level subspecies. A view's subspecies title is context; it is not substituted for an absent sample-level identification. All hosts and result states are retained. |
| `SINTOMO`, `SINTOMI` | Recorded visible drying symptoms. `Presente` and `Assente` become presence/absence; the unexplained code `0` stays unknown. The publisher states that drying symptoms are not a diagnosis. |
| Native geometry/CRS, latitude/longitude, municipality and cadastral fields | Published location. SIT supplies EPSG:32633; workbooks give longitude/latitude columns that establish axes, not a datum. Neither states positional error, so metric use waits for the population row's qualification. |
| `DOCUMENTO_CONFERMA`, `LNK_DOCUMENTO_SELGE`, `DOCUMENTO_DECRETO`; protocol and laboratory fields | Literal routes and identifiers for the report or act owning the next fact, exposed without interpreting the unread document. |
| Team, field notes, inspection details, removal labels and protection/parcel annotations | Retained on their own observation. They can lead the respective input owner to a source fact; an annotation does not fill a removal, permission or completion event. |

What the stream hands A–C, all as candidates:

- Positive observations with their day, agreed coordinates per frame and report
  route (`detection_days`, `located_positives`) for the no-detection anchor and
  the finding location. The report decides the finding. `detection_record_complete`
  is never set from the release inventory: the publisher says surveillance is not
  an inventory of all infected plants, and the inventory proves only that every
  retained release was read.
- Distinct observations with an agreed result per caller-defined occasion
  (`occasion_sets`) for negative-survey support. They are observations, not
  inspection units; unit identity needs the plant population row, so
  `observation_inventory_complete` stays unsupplied.
- Over 2013–2026: 29,770 distinct positive observations, 1,720,384 distinct
  negatives, and 570,200 with no agreed result (inspections and assessments
  without a result field, pending, doubtful, duplicate-only, blank, and the
  disagreements below).

What the population shows, read and not reconciled:

- In 2013–2017 cross-release correspondence is unavailable: the workbooks carry
  no reference (223,458 observations) and the SIT views use daily counters
  (229,358 rows reused within their own view on one day). Those observations are
  counted per publication.
- 16,569 identified observations (0.9%) have publications that disagree on a
  field: species 16,523, coordinates 2,350, result 1,543, symptoms 2. From 2018
  on the species disagreement is a spelling convention — the positives views
  write `OLIVO` where the host views, infected-plant layers and workbooks write
  `Olivo (Olea europaea)` for the same observation — so nearly every positive
  carries one; it is exposed, not resolved, and it is not identity doubt. The
  6,471 disagreeing observations of 2013–2017 are mostly counter collisions
  across views, where a visual inspection and a sample share one value on one
  day. Only a result disagreement withholds an observation from the positive
  and negative counts. No publication is preferred.
- The publisher's projections disagree with each other. For 1 October–31 December
  2021, a period chosen after the reader was written, the adapter yields 1,772
  distinct positive observations on 33 days; the positives views hold 1,772 rows;
  the infected-plant layer and the workbook hold 1,769. The three extra are
  observations the positives view publishes and the other two do not.

## Materials that are not standalone input gaps

- The BURP URL census is a way to locate regional acts. It is not itself a decision
  input.
- The 194-service SIT catalogue is a discovery surface. A service enters only when
  one of the rows above requires it; there is no remaining obligation to adjudicate
  194 services for their own sake.
- Municipal archives are used only for a required publication or notice event.
  Their complete general history is not a CORDON population.
- Historical removal records enter only when an accepted present or prospective
  input needs that history.
- Public and state land data enter only for standing or permission on affected
  land.
- PPTR, municipal plans and landscape proceedings enter only for an affected plant
  whose accepted branch requires that protection or permission.
- Large-file backup and repository preservation are engineering concerns. They are
  not evidence inputs and are not Stage D completion conditions.
- “Difficult source tables,” “copy relationships,” and “adoption lineage” describe
  work that a particular row may require. They are not separate source families or
  reasons to expand the aperture.
